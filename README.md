# VirtualRequestGenerator
Python Script for Generating an input.txt file for use on your UPRRP CCOM4017 Fall 2018 Homework #3

Script works as is. Currently tested working with python 2.X without any problems. Should also be the case for 3.X

Usage: python generate.py **[highest possible virtual page]** **[total amount of requests]**

Program also has a built in -h and documentation on usage in case you need it.

input.txt gets overwritten every run, and every command is in it's own line which makes it easier to parse into your program (In my opinion).
